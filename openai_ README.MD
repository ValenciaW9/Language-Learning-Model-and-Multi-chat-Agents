# Embedded Systems Monitoring with OpenAI Integration

#This project simulates embedded systems monitoring using OpenAI's API. It generates random sensor data for various embedded boards and provides functions for fine-tuning an OpenAI model and generating completions based on predefined roles.

## Installation

##```bash
#pip install openai
#```

## Usage

#1. Set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables or directly in the code. **Note:** Itâ€™s recommended to keep your API key secure and not expose it in public repositories.

#2. Run the script. It will display sensor data for different embedded boards, create a fine-tuning job on OpenAI, list active fine-tuning jobs, and test the model with sample questions.

#```bash
#python embedded_systems_monitoring.py
#```

## Features

##- **Embedded Board Simulation**: Create and display information for various embedded boards (e.g., Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32) along with simulated sensor readings.

##- **OpenAI API Integration**: Create fine-tuning jobs for the OpenAI model and generate completions based on specific roles.

#- **Testing Framework**: Test the fine-tuned model against expected answers to ensure accuracy.

## Functions

# `EmbeddedBoard`
# **`display_info(self)`**: Displays information about the embedded board and its sensors.

# `generate_sensor_data()`

#Displays information for all created boards.

## `fine_tune_openai_model(training_file, model="gpt-4")`

#Creates a fine-tuning job on OpenAI using the provided training file.

### `list_fine_tuning_jobs()`

#Lists active fine-tuning jobs.

### `create_completion_with_role(model_id, messages, role="assistant")`

#Generates completions based on the provided role (e.g., assistant, teacher, developer, counselor).

### `test_model(questions_and_answers)`

#Tests the fine-tuned model against expected answers and prints the results.

## Example

#```python
#if __name__ == "__main__":
    #  display_boards_info()

   # fine_tune_openai_model(training_file="file-abc123")  # Replace with your actual training file ID

   # list_fine_tuning_jobs()

   # questions_and_answers = [
        ("Explain how to optimize memory usage in embedded systems.", 
        "To optimize memory usage, use efficient data structures and algorithms, manage memory allocation properly, and avoid memory leaks."),
        ("How can I optimize the clock speed of my Raspberry Pi 4 board?", 
        "To optimize clock speed, adjust the CPU frequency settings in the config file and ensure proper cooling to prevent thermal throttling."),
    ]

    test_results = test_model(questions_and_answers)
