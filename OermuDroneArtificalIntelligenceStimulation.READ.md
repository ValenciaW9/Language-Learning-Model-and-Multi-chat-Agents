Drone Surveillance System with QEMU and AI Integration

Overview

This project is a Python-based drone surveillance system that leverages AI for intruder detection, QEMU for RISC-V system emulation, and Flask for web-based interaction. It integrates OpenAI APIs for enhanced functionality and supports Twilio for SMS alerts and SMTP for email notifications.

The main execution file is:

/absolute/path/to/oremu_Drone_Artiffical_intelligence_Stimulation.py

Features
	•	Drone Surveillance
Real-time video feed from the drone with AI-based motion detection and intruder recognition.
	•	QEMU RISC-V Emulation
Start and manage a RISC-V emulated system and interact with the emulated environment through commands.
	•	Notification System
Sends alerts via SMS (Twilio) and email (SMTP) on intruder detection.
	•	Web Interface
Flask-powered API and front-end interface for managing monitoring operations.

Dependencies
	•	Python 3.x
	•	DroneKit
	•	OpenCV (cv2)
	•	Flask
	•	Twilio SDK
	•	OpenAI Python API
	•	QEMU for RISC-V emulation

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-surveillance-qemu.git
cd drone-surveillance-qemu

2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
TWILIO_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

4. Configure QEMU

Ensure you have QEMU installed:

sudo apt-get install qemu-system-misc

Update the QEMU_BINARY and QEMU_IMAGE paths in the script to point to your local QEMU binary and RISC-V image.

5. Run the Application

Run the main file directly using its absolute path:

python /absolute/path/to/oremu_Drone_Artiffical_intelligence_Stimulation.py

The Flask server will start, and you can visit http://localhost:5000 to access the interface.

Usage

Starting Surveillance
	1.	Launch the application:

python /absolute/path/to/oremu_Drone_Artiffical_intelligence_Stimulation.py


	2.	Trigger the /run-monitoring endpoint via the web interface or a POST request:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/run-monitoring


	3.	The system will:
	•	Start QEMU emulation.
	•	Monitor the drone feed for intruders.
	•	Send notifications and execute commands in the emulated RISC-V system if an intruder is detected.

Future Enhancements
	•	Additional AI Features
Add object classification to distinguish between humans and animals.
	•	Enhanced QEMU Interaction
Implement bi-directional communication with the emulated system for advanced command execution.
	•	Deployment
Dockerize the application for seamless deployment.
